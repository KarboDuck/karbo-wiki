## "num_of_copies" allows to start several copies of runner.py.
## Each copy will choose different target from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarboDuck/karbo-wiki/master/runner_targets
## This is different from "multiple targets" in runner.py. Built in runner.py "multiple targets" can attack multiple IP's but only with same one method.
## "num_of_copies" allows to launch several copies of runner.py and targets will be attacked with different methods, if specified.
